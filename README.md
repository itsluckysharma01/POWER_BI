## 🔧 Data Modeling Best Practices

### Relationship Design

```
Customers (1) → (*) Orders → (*) Order Details ← (*) Products
    ↓                                                ↑
Payments (*)                                Product Lines (1)

Employees (1) → (*) Customers
    ↓
Offices (1)
```

### Recommended Measures (DAX)

```dax
Total Revenue = SUMX('Order Details', 'Order Details'[Quantity] * 'Order Details'[Price Each])

YTD Sales = TOTALYTD([Total Revenue], 'Orders'[Order Date])

Customer Count = DISTINCTCOUNT('Orders'[Customer Number])

Average Order Value = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Order Count])
```
